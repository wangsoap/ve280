\subsection{IO}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Buffered Input streams}

The only input stream is \texttt{cin}, the standard input stream. The input stream is buffered.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item When you hit keyboard, the OS receives the keyboard key stroke and buffers what you type. \item You can always modify your input at this point.
	\item When you hit enter (or CTRL-C, etc.), OS sends the inputs to your program.
	\item Your program itself again buffers the input it receives.
	\item Read from your programs' buffer when you extract from \texttt{cin}.
\end{enumerate}	


It is somewhat useful to know that, when you hit enter, not only the your previous inputs are sent to the program, but also the "enter" keystroke it self. What is the ASCII character for the "enter" key?

If you are to write interactive programs, e.g. games that responds to direction keys, you will have to work with the underlying operating systems. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{How does input stream work?}
If we are to understand the behavior of input streams, we must turn to its internal workings. The input stream follows a 3 step procedure
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the input stream character by character.
\item Based on the read characters, and target stop at some point.
\item Convert what you read into required type.
\end{enumerate}
We demonstrate on an example. Suppose you try to execute 

\begin{minted}{c++}
string stt; cin >> str;  // cin contains "123abc hello world"
\end{minted}

\begin{itemize}
\item Read the input stream until it hits a blank character.
\item The blank character remains in the stream. 
\item Trim the string, remove all leading blanks.
\item Copies the result into \texttt{str}.
\item The stream is left with \texttt{ hello world}, 1 leading space.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{How does input stream work? Cont'}
The following is a summary of usually behaviors of common behavior extraction operators. \textbf{based on my memory}. Suppose:
\begin{minted}{c++}
T var; cin >> var;
\end{minted}
\begin{itemize}
\item If \texttt{T} is numeric types, such as \texttt{int}. 1) First character might be the sign. 2) Reads until the first non-digit character 3) The non-digit character is left in the stream. 
\item If \texttt{T} is \texttt{char}. It extracts exactly one character from the stream, no matter what that character is. Equivalent to \texttt{getch()}.
\item if \texttt{T} is \texttt{char*}. It do exactly as the string. In the final step it copies the characters read to where the pointer points. \textit{It is dangerous because of buffer overflow.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{minted}{c++}
istream& getline(istream& is, std::string& str);
\end{minted}

This function 1) Reads from the stream \texttt{is} 2) Stops until a newline character. 3) The encountered new line character is \textbf{extracted out, but ditched} (not copied into \texttt{str}) 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Avoid parsing whenever possible!}
Specifically, avoid using \texttt{getline()} and \texttt{getch()} whenever possible. The C++ extractors has a very nice property: if you try to extract numbers or strings, the extractor automatically ignores blank characters. This means you only need to focus on the question of 
\begin{center}
\textit{WHAT is the next thing I need?}
\end{center}

instead of thinking 
\begin{itemize}
\item WHERE is the next thing I need?
\item Is what I need on the next line?
\item Is there a space or a tab before what I need?
\item How do I get rid of that space / tab / newline?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{The failed state}
If you try to extract invalid things from the stream, the stream enters a so called \textit{Failed State}. 

Two typical situation where a input stream will enter a fail state is when you try to extract things from an empty stream (all things in the stream has be extracted). Or you extracted the wrong type.

In general the second situation should be avoided. If you are not sure what next thing is, use a string to accept it. Transform the string into expected type later.

You can test whether a stream is in a valid state (very often if there is still thing remains in the stream) by simply \texttt{if(stream)}.

A very commonly used idiom to extract everything is:

\begin{minted}{c++}
int num; while(cin >> num) /* Do something here */;
\end{minted}

Please note that extractor operator returns an reference of the left hand stream.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Buffered Output Streams}
There are 2 output streams \texttt{cout} and \texttt{cerr}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{cout} is the standard output stream. It is buffered. 
\item \texttt{cerrr} is the standard error stream. It is NOT buffered. 
\end{itemize}

File outputs are almost always buffered. If an output stream is buffered, it usually works as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item Your program stores the output in a buffer.
\item When the buffer is full, or explicitly flushed, your program sends the buffer content to OS.
\item The OS puts the content into a file, or onto the screen (which is also a ``file", remember?).
\item Inserting a \texttt{std::flush}, or \texttt{std::endl} flushes the buffer.
\end{itemize}

Standard output streams accepts normal program outputs. On the other hand, \texttt{cerr} accepts error messages, \textbf{warnings} and \textbf{diagnostic messages}. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Buffer, flush and performance}

\textit{Buffering} have a few implications, or more likely problems. 

\begin{itemize}
\item If your program crashed at some point, information in the buffer will be lost and thus not print out (for this reason \texttt{cerr} is not buffered).
\item There is an extra overhead of maintaining the consistence of the C++ style streamed IO with C style \texttt{printf}, \texttt{puts}... 
\end{itemize}

And there's more to it. Although \texttt{cout} and \texttt{cerr} are two different streams, they usually both goes to the stream.  If you output to both of them, for example

\begin{minted}{c++}
cout << "Hello "; cerr << " Gotcha "; cout << "World!"
\end{minted}

It is possible you see any one the following three (why?): 1) \texttt{Hello Gotcha World!} 2) \texttt{Gotcha Hello World?} 3) \texttt{Hello World! Gotcha}. What to do if I want to ensure the order?
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Buffer, flush and performance, Cont'}

Why do we need such buffer? If it causes so many problems? 

The reason is actually performance, flushing the buffer, or printing things onto the screen requires an interaction with the operating system, which is very expensive!

Buffer is an attempt reduce the number of such interaction by trying to send as much text as possible out at once. Compare:

\begin{minted}{c++}
for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) cout << "Hello" << endl;
for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) cout << "Hello" << "\n";
\end{minted}

Generally the first one could be at least 3 times slower than the second one. This will be significant in the runtime of your program since your projects are often IO heavy (outputs a lot).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Type signature of extraction / insertion operators}
The reason why C++ iostream can work seamlessly with various types, is because it uses operator overloading and inheritance. The type signature of the extraction operator (often) has the following type (general) signature.

\begin{minted}{c++}
istream& operator>>(istream& is, T& var); 
ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const T& var);  
\end{minted}

The standard library provides the following for \texttt{std::string}s. 
\begin{minted}{c++}
istream& operator>>(istream&, std::string&); 
ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const std::string&);
\end{minted}

For smaller types, insertion operator may accept pass-by-values, not const references.
\begin{minted}{c++}
istream& operator>>(istream& is, int& var); 
ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, int var);
\end{minted}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Type signature of extraction / insertion operators, cont'}

\begin{minted}{c++}
istream& operator>>(istream& is, T& var); 
ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const T& var);
\end{minted}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each type that supports extraction has its own overloading of the function. 
\item All sources that supports character-by-character reading inherits from \texttt{istream}. For example, the input file stream \texttt{ifstream}.
\item For extraction operator, variable is passed by reference, allows putting the value ``into" the variable. 
\item For insertion operator, variable is passed often by \textbf{const reference}. Why?
\item The operator returns first argument as its return value. This allows ``chaining" the extraction / insertion. 
\item Functions like \texttt{getline()} also follows this convention. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Chaining extraction / insertion operator}
A C++ beginner always quickly get used to write things like:
\begin{minted}{c++}
int x, y; char c1, c2; std::string str; 
getline(cin >> x >> c1, str) >> c2 >> y;
\end{minted}
The syntax is very concise compared to C (\texttt{fscanf()}). The question is, how does it work, without specifying the format string?

The secret is mainly lies in the type signature of extraction operators, specifically:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Extraction (insertion) operators are left associative, meaning parentheses are grouped left to right.
	\item Compiler chooses overloads according to the second argument. This avoids the \texttt{scanf()} style format string. 
	\item Operators return a reference to the stream. 
\end{itemize}
Remark: this example demonstrates what is known as \textit{static polymorphism}, where the identical code is resolved to different function calls at compile time.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Chaining extraction / insertion operator, Cont'}
We apply parentheses to previous example:
\begin{minted}{c++}
(getline(((cin >> x) >> c1), str) >> c2 )>> y;
\end{minted}
The first thing to evaluate the is the argument of \texttt{getline(...)}. Note that \texttt{cin} is of type \texttt{istream}, \texttt{x} is of type {int}. The compiler chooses overload:
\begin{minted}{c++}
istream& operator>>(istream& is, int& var);  
\end{minted}
It takes \texttt{cin} as \texttt{is}, \texttt{x} as \texttt{var}. After extracting one integer from \texttt{cin} it again returns the reference of \texttt{cin}. 
\begin{minted}{c++}
((...) /* Evaluates to cin */ >> c1)
\end{minted}
This allows the compiler to deduce the second overload for \texttt{c1}. 
\begin{minted}{c++}
istream& operator>>(istream& is, char& var);  
\end{minted}
This goes recursively on and on. It should now also be clear why \texttt{getline()} should return a reference to its first argument. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Writing a tree to standard output}
This is a code snippet from the VE280 Online judge code that write a tree to standard output.  A tree is can be written out in the form \texttt{[ tree\_elt [\{left\_tree\}] [\{right\_tree\}] ]}. For example \texttt{[ 2 [ 1 \$ [ 3 \$ \$ ] ] [ 1 [ 4 \$ \$ ] [ 6 \$ \$ ] ] ]}. The \texttt{\$} represents empty tree.

%\begin{frame}[fragile]{Tips on working with input stream}
%\framesubtitle{A VG101 Problem}
%Recall the following VG101 problem (guess lots of you suffered...):
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig/rc5_vg101}
%\end{figure}
%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Tips on working with file streams}
File streams are very much like \texttt{cin} or \texttt{cout}. Please note the difference of \texttt{ifstream} and \texttt{ofstream} and \texttt{fstream}. 

File streams can be opened on construction:
\begin{minted}{c++}
ifstream inputFileStream("input.txt");
\end{minted}
Above code opens \texttt{input.txt} with a \texttt{ifstream}. Please note if the file doesn't exist or failed to open, your \texttt{inputFileStream} will be in a failed state. Remember to check!

Although you can use \texttt{inputFileSteam.close()} to close the stream (and clear its buffer), but you don't actually need to. Remember the stack unwinding example we have before? Standard libraries' file stream are exactly such objects. Its deconstructor will take care of the closing and freeing the file.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Use \texttt{istringstream} as parser }
A \texttt{stringstream} can either act be an input stream, or an output stream. They are very different! 

\texttt{istringstream} needs to be ``attached" to a string. This can be down by either passing the string in on construction or use its \texttt{.str()} method. The stringstream, unlike \texttt{cin}, doesn't consume the string, instead it attach a ``pointer" to the string. Ideally:

\begin{minted}{text}
123 abc def Hello world  |  123 abc def Hello world
|<-sstream               |     |<-sstream 
\end{minted}

Right side is after extracting 123 through \texttt{sstream >> intVar;}

\texttt{istringstream} is especially useful in treating data acquired from \texttt{getline}. 

\alert{If you need to use the same \texttt{istringstream} object for multiple strings, you need to clear it when changing string}. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Use \texttt{ostringstream} as string builder}
From time to time we need to convert different type of data into a string. For example, information about a student is described by:
\begin{minted}{c++}
strcut Student {
string name; int grade; Date birthday; double GPA;
};
\end{minted}
And you need to turn such stuctures into below format
\begin{minted}{c++}
%name, %grade grade, %YYYY-MM-DD, gpa = %gpa"
\end{minted}
You can setup an \texttt{ostringstream}. You simply push into the stream as if it is \texttt{cout}, finally you call \texttt{ostringstream.str()} to get the result. 
\begin{minted}{c++}
oss << name << "," << grade << " grade" << ... 
\end{minted}
The design of the stream makes it very efficient in dealing with large amount of text. For example you can use it to prepare data to send over the Internet.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Data Abstraction with \texttt{class}es}
\begin{frame}{Once another look on data types: Duck typing}
Consider the problem: 
\begin{center}
	\structure{Define what a ``Duck" is?}
\end{center}
The very answer from \textit{Alex Martelli} is:
\begin{quotation}
	In other words, don't check whether it IS-a duck: check whether it QUACKS-like-a duck, WALKS-like-a duck, etc, etc, depending on exactly what subset of duck-like behaviour you need to play your language-games with.
\end{quotation}
The whole purpose of having data type is to model things. We use \texttt{struct} to model what something consists. But things are only useful when we interact with them. The \textit{observable} effects are all we care. \alert{The whole point of data abstraction is to model the behavior of objects}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Abstract Data type}
The central idea is:
\begin{center}
\structure{Data type IS Abstraction.}
\end{center}
Always define a datatype in terms of what it can do, what kind of operations are supported for this datatype, and \alert{there should be nothing more}. Also define what you \alert{CANNOT} do with such data.
\begin{description}[Information Hiding]
\item[Information Hiding] Actual implementation of the object is hidden away, the outside can't see, and shouldn't see what's inside.
\item[Encapsulation] Operations become part of the type. 
\item[Locality] Other components only depend on exposed operations (i.e. interfaces), nothing more. This is different for \texttt{struct}.
\item[Substitutable] Change the implementable preserves program correctness.
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Designing ADTs with \texttt{class}es}
We would like specify an Integer class:
\begin{columns}[]
\column{.5\textwidth}

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{minted}{c++}
class Natural {
// OVERVIEW: An N
public:
void  set(int v);
// EFFECT:  ...
// MODIFIES: this
Natural  add(Natural v);
Natural  mul(Natural v);
int get();
private:
int value;
};
Natrual num;
\end{minted}
\column{.6\textwidth}

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{itemize}
\small
\item \texttt{class} key word begins the specification of an abstract datatype. CamelCase style recommand you to capitalize first character.
\item \texttt{public} key words begins specifying the \textit{operations}, the \textit{abstaction}, or we say the \textit{interface}. Pay attention to the \texttt{MODIFIES: this}.
\item \texttt{private} key words calls for actual implementation.
\item Note what's not there: a \texttt{div} method. Dividing natural numbers usually don't give you natural numbers.
\item \texttt{num} is called an \textit{object}. \texttt{num} is an \textit{instance} of \texttt{Natural}. 
\end{itemize}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Implementing \texttt{class}es}
We now need to try to implement a class. We focus especially implementing class methods (member functions are usually called \textit{methods}.). 

\vspace{0.1in}
The declaration of a class is usually written in a \textit{header file}. For the example of last page we usually implement it in \texttt{natural.h}. The name of the file usually is the same as the class you are implement.  

\vspace{0.1in}
Class methods can be implemented either when you declare the class, or in a separate \texttt{.cpp} file. For our above example we usually implement it in the \texttt{natural.cpp}.

\vspace{0.1in}
Whenever you need to use a class, you include its header file. Usually each header file only contains definition of one single class, unless you have a couple of tightly related class. 
\end{frame}

return n;

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A remark on \texttt{private}}
\texttt{private} means private to class, not to instance. 
\begin{columns}[]

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{minted}{c++}
class Human {
int leg;
public:
int swapLeg(Human& h) {

}
};
Human h1; h1.setLeg(10);
Human h2; h2.setLeg(3);

\end{minted}

\column{.65\textwidth}

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{itemize}
\item Code on the left compiles and runs without problem.
\item It's sometimes called "Since we are both human why can't I swap my leg to yours" effect.
\item This indicates the design choice that \texttt{private} is a technique to hide abstraction implementation, other than to prevent outside modification. 
\item Members are \alert{\texttt{private} by defualt} in a \texttt{class}. Recall that \texttt{struct} are just \texttt{class} whose member are by default \texttt{public}
\end{itemize}

\item Members (including methods) are \alert{always} accesses through \texttt{this} keyword, either explicitly (in \texttt{set()} method), or implicitly (\texttt{get()} method).
\item If there is an ambiguity you can use \texttt{this} to resolve ambiguity. In the \texttt{set} method, LHS refers to member and RHS refers to the argument.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{const} member function and ripple effect}
A member function can be declared as \texttt{const} to signify it will not change any member (in any possible way). The declaration must be done both in the declaration and in the implementation:

\begin{columns}
\column{.45\textwidth}

\vspace{-.25in}

\end{minted}
\end{columns}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{const} methods cannot modify any member
\item \texttt{const} methods may only invoke other \texttt{const} methods.
\end{itemize}
You already know the basic rules of \texttt{const} methods. But unfortunately the situation (you will be facing) is much complicated (when you get to STLs). We now make a further discussion. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{const} member function and propagation}
To illustrate the problem, we here uses a functionality called \textit{Runtime Type Info (RTTI)} to let the compiler spit out the types.

\texttt{* code/rc8const/main.cpp}
\inputminted[fontsize=\small, baselinestretch=0.865]{c++}{code/rc8const/main.cpp}

\begin{frame}{\texttt{const} member function and ripple effect}
We take down (and translate for you) the output of the program
\begin{description}[\texttt{bar()::value}]

\item[\texttt{baz()::this}] pointer to \texttt{Foo}
\item[\texttt{baz()::value}] pointer to \texttt{int}

Essentially we have the following 3 rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item In a \texttt{const} method, \texttt{this} have type \texttt{const Class*}
\item Non \texttt{const} member functions are not allowed to be accessed from a \texttt{const} object.
\item Any member variable accessed through a \texttt{const}ed \texttt{this} keyword is automatically const quantified.
\end{itemize}
We provide some examples to explain them.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{const} ripple effect: Example }
Consider the following 2 classes
\begin{columns}

\column[]{.4\textwidth}
\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{minted}{c++}
class Integer {
int value;
public:
int get();
void set(int i);
};
\end{minted}

\column[]{.6\textwidth}
\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{minted}[]{c++}
class Bar {
Integer i;  Complicated c;
void doComp(); // uses c
public:
int getValue() { 
doComp(); return i.get(); 
} };
\end{minted}
\end{columns}

Suppose there exists a function that originally looks like:
\begin{minted}{c++}
void baz(Bar bar); // Do complicated work
\end{minted}
The function passes \texttt{Bar} by value. It was alright, until bar becomes really large. A quick fix is proposed. Somehow you know function does not modify the argument, you suggest to change it to 
\begin{minted}{c++}
void baz(const Bar& bar); // Do complicated work
\end{minted}
Pretty harmless change? What could be possibly go wrong?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\texttt{const} ripple effect: Example}
Well it isn't! Let's see what happens:
\begin{itemize}
\small
\item We know \texttt{baz} calls \texttt{getValue} from \texttt{Bar} class. Since we change the argument to const reference. We can no long do that, since you cannot call a non-const member function on a const object.
\item You change \texttt{Bar::getValue()} to const member function. But this gives you 2 more problems (what are they?).
\item You tackle the easier one. Since \texttt{i} in \texttt{Bar::getValue()} is now const object, you have to change \texttt{Integer::get()} also to const member function.
\item Another problem is \texttt{doComp()} is not const. This function does really complicated calculation with \texttt{i} and \texttt{c}. 
\item You have no choice but to mark \texttt{Bar::doComp()} as const. This forces you inspect every member function of \texttt{Complicated} class, and change them to \texttt{const}.
\item Now you realize this will never end! There are simply more and more things to change. You ends up rewriting the entire code base! 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{const} ripple effect: Example}
Things you observed is sometimes called the ``ripple effect" of \texttt{const} keyword: when you change $X$, you ends up changing all things related to $X$, and this goes on and \texttt{const} ends up ``infecting" everything.

There are in general 2 ways to stop this effect, both of them are dangerous and far from satisfaction.
\begin{itemize}
\item A \texttt{const\_cast}. The programmer explicitly asks the compiler to stop checking constness and tell the compiler to trust him. 
\item Make a non-const copy of the original object. Pass that object along. This has a obvious performance drawback.
\end{itemize}

The lesson behind this is you \alert{constness is a all-or-nothing deal}. You either do it from the begging till the end, and never at all. Constness is considered good practice. It provides very powerful assurance on correctness. So our advice is simple:
\begin{center}
\alert{Do \texttt{const}, and do it in full scale!}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Building source file containing classes}
We now turn to ask the question how classes are compiled. This is important for the following two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item How classes are compiled are related to the memory representation of classes. Many design choices on classes are (or were) have something to do with this.
\item You could encounter various strange problem in your project or in a real life situation. Knowing them helps to grasp the situation. 
\end{itemize}
Historically C++ was derived from a language called \textit{C With Classes}. One of the first C++ compiler will first translate C++ code into C code, then a C compiler compiles it into machine code. 

\vspace{0.03in}
We will notice that classes are (once were) merely C structures with some syntax sugar. We will also begin to notice how much trouble does the C linking strategy introduce into the language, and becomes prominent problem in its course of development. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{On compiling classes}
The code on the left will be compiled, as if, it was written in the form of the right hand side

\begin{columns}

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{minted}[baselinestretch=.9, fontsize=\small]{c++}
class Clock {
int hour;
public:
void setHour(int h) {
hour = h;
}
int getHour() const {
return hour;
}
};
void foo() {
Clock clock; 
clock.setHour(10);
clock.getHour();

}
\end{minted}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{On compiling classes}
Now you should find the pattern:
\begin{itemize}
\item Classes are arranged in memory exactly like structures. We used to say ``structures are just classes whose members are all public". On a memory point of view, it's the other way around.
\item \alert{Methods are compiled into usual functions}, with one extra argument, the \texttt{this} keyword.
\item Dot operator (e.g. \texttt{clock.setHour}) are translated into usual function calls.
\item All members are accessed through the this parameter. The reason is now obvious.
\item \texttt{const} methods results in a \texttt{const} \texttt{this}.
\item \texttt{static} methods (if you still remember what they are), are just methods that does not take the extra argument (thus they are shared among all instances).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{On compiling classes: Linking}

We first go over a few things we already know about the building process (and see which of them are violated!):
\begin{itemize}
\item Building process is mainly about compiling and linking
\item Each source file compiles independently.
\item Each entity must have one definition and one only (ODR).
\end{itemize}

We have looked at  look at the linking stage. 

\vspace{.05in}
Remember information about classes are ``thrown away" in the compiling stage. When it comes to linking, we are only linking function calls together. Functions are all that we care.

\vspace{.05in}	
Every class method will be turned into a function. We keep that in mind and see the following slides.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{On linking classes: the setup}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{On linking classes: the setup}
We accompany above with the following driving program

\texttt{[code/rc8class/main.cpp]}:
\inputminted[]{c++}{code/rc8class/main.cpp}

Compile the code and execute it:
\begin{minted}{text}
g++ main.cpp dec.cpp inc.cpp integer.cpp && ./a.out
\end{minted}
We observer the (not surprising) result \texttt{10 11 10}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{On linking classes}
We now take a step back and think. In the preprocessing stage we already knows that files included by \texttt{\#include} are copied into the file, this is (unfortunately) also true for \texttt{integer.h}:

\vspace{-0.1in}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{fig/rc8link1}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{On linking classes}
Pairs of the same color are linked together:
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{fig/rc8link2}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{On linking classes}
Thus the guideline is very simple:
\begin{itemize}
\item Methods defined inside the class decls are linked internally.
\item Methods defined in a separate \texttt{.cpp} source file are linked as if they are usual functions.
\end{itemize}
From a performance point of view, writing a definition of method inside the class declaration implies that the method is very simple. So instead of generating a function call whenever used the compiler will try to copy the code to each place it is used, avoiding the overhead of calling a function. This is called \textit{inlining}. 

\vspace{0.05in}
A remark we haven't made yet is \textit{abstraction always have an overhead}, a cost that we must endure to enable better flexibility. For classes, function calling mechanism is the overhead. Naturally people would want them both, i.e. ``zero cost abstraction". The way C++ achieves it is through allowing compiler to heavily optimize your code, and inlining methods is one major technique.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Working with class invariants}	
\begin{frame}{Invariants of a datatype}
We now take a look at the implementation side. From a implementation point of view, what's the difference between a list of integers, and a set of integers? 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Both of them probably are represented using an array.
	\item Both of them might need to keep track of current number of elements. 
\end{itemize} 
The major difference lies in the fact that when inserting an element, integer set must check whether the element already exists. It is the assumptions on the member that makes them different.

\vspace{0.05in}
Integer set has one more assumption than integer list. Each number in the array must be unique. Every operation of an integer set must start with this assumption, might broke it in the middle, but ends up with it.

\vspace{0.05in}
We will use your \texttt{IntSet} example in class for our discussion.
\end{frame}

		\item \texttt{insert} might broke all three.

		\item L.9 operator \texttt{++} restores inv.
		\item Inv.3 ensures \texttt{remove} works.
		\item L.15 restores inv.1. L.16 restores inv.2. A significant amount of code is dedicated to preserving invs.

\begin{frame}{Remarks on invariants}
We would like to note the following things:
\begin{center}
	\structure{The centric problem in choosing an implementation\\ for an ADT, is choosing the invariants.}
\end{center}
There are multiple ways to write an implementation an \texttt{IntSet} of course. The major difference of them, is they need to keep different invariants, and thus have different performance. 

For example, you have already seen \texttt{IntSet} implemented using a sorted array. The one extra invariant you need to keep is that elements are sorted. Based on that extra invariant:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Queries are much quicker.
	\item Deletion and insertion are slower (by a constant factor).
\end{itemize}
In VE281 you will see (many) other ways of implementing this IntSet, for example using hash tables, or balance trees. It is always helpful to understand what the invariant for an implementation.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Invariants and bad practices}
Thinking about invariants immediately gives us hints on what are seemingly good, some even sounds terrific, but are actually pretty bad ideas. We now take a look at some of them.

\begin{description}[Alice]
	\small
	\item[Alice] I'd like to add a public method to \texttt{IntSet}, let's say \texttt{find()}, which takes an element, found it in the set, and returns an reference to that element. 
	\item [Bob] Why do you want to do that?
	\item [Alice] Well my code needs to modify elements in the array, a lot. This would significantly accelerate the process.
	\item [Bob] ...
	\item [Alice] Oh, I get it, it's a pretty bad idea. OK I have another idea, I want to add a method, \texttt{data()}, which returns the pointer to array, since my code needs to iterate through the set. 
	\item [Bob] ...
	\item [Alice] What if I return pointer to const?
	\item [Bob] ...
	\item [Alice] Well, I give up. It's not as easy as I thought.
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Invariants and bad practices}
Well Alice does have her point. Her requirements are very real and the solutions does solutions could work, but remember the words from \textit{Donald Knuth}:
\begin{quotation}
	\structure{Premature optimization is the root of all evil}.
\end{quotation}
Never trade correctness for performance in designing phase. 
\begin{itemize}
	\small
	\item 1st and 2nd change Alice proposed have the problem that the client could change the content of the internal array, without notifying the instance. There is by no means the instance can guarantee the new value won't violate uniqueness invariance.
	\item Now Alice proposes the third one. The \texttt{const} key word could prevent the element from being modified. But it exposes the implementation to outside. Now the fact that elements are stored in a linear array becomes part of the abstraction, you can no longer change that. The problem is, iterating through a set seems to be an important feature, we DO need that. Well, the correct solution is using iterators, you will know them later in this course.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Invariants and the constructor}
\alert{Invariants are there as long as the object is there.} The earliest moment the object is created, is when it is defined. Classes, are just structures, in terms of memory. Structures contains undefined values when created, so naturally does the classes. 

\vspace{0.03in}
Think about \texttt{IntSet}, when the object is created, chances are \texttt{numElts} contains non-zero value, while your set should be empty.

\vspace{0.03in}
We need a mechanism, a function, that is invoked whenever the an instance is created. This function is called, and called always, to initialize the object, or more strictly, to setup the invariance.

\vspace{0.03in}
Such special functions are \alert{constructors}, or \alert{ctors} for short. From this point on it's important to think the initialization, not as assigning special values to member variables, but as invoking the constructor to setup invariants (together with the initial state, e.g. initialize the \texttt{IntSet} with one default element in it for whatever reason).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Constructors: Syntax}

		\small
		\item Ctors have same name as class.
		\item Ctors don't return anything. 
		\item Usually \texttt{public}, but could be \texttt{private} for special need.
		\item A class could have more than one ctor, depending on what the initial state should be. We say the constructor is overloaded.
		\item Ctors could take initialization list.
		\item Ctor is the first function being called when the object is created. Unfortunately ``created" is not as simple as it sounds.
		\item A ctor that does not take argument is called \texttt{a default ctor}. Every class must always have a ctor. If you don't specify \alert{any ctor}, a ctor is synthesized for you (under some conditions).
	\end{itemize}
\end{columns}
\tiny{* We left out copy/move constructors on purpose. You will learn them later.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Constructors: Explanations}
We need to break down the words from previous slide. We first look at the first four lines. The first three seems direct. For the fourth one:
\begin{minted}{c++}
IntSet set1; // set1 is init to an empty set;
IntSet set2(10); // set2 contains single elem 10
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{c++}
int foo(const IntSet& s1, const IntSet& s2);
foo(IntSet(), IntSet(10)); // Anymous construction
\end{minted}

Further more, latest C++ standard guarantees the following:
\begin{minted}{c++}
IntSet setx = IntSet();    // Same as set1 
IntSet sety = IntSet(10);  // Same as set2
IntSet setz = 10;          // Same as set2
\end{minted}
This is non-trivial, for reasons you will see one or two weeks later. This is called \textit{guaranteed copy elision}. Now some food for thought: 

Why \texttt{set1} is not initialized as \texttt{IntSet set1();} for consistency?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Constructors: Explanations}
We now question: Is constructor really the first function being called when created? Well that depends on how you understand ``created"! One should argue the ctor IS part of object creation.

\vspace{0.1in}
In fact, there are 4 steps (roughly) in creating an class instance.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Allocation of space, we (in general) don't have control over.
	\item Construction of the base class object.
	\item Construction of the members of current class.
	\item Calling the constructor.
\end{enumerate}
These 4 steps goes recursively. In fact the constructor is the last function being called. This is natural. 

When the constructor is called, we should be able to use all member variables and base class. So their invariants must have been setup in advance! This is the only way things makes sense.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Initializer list: Setup}
The \textit{initializer list}, the things after colon controls the second and third step. 

\begin{minted}{c++}
ClsName::ClsName() : base(..), m1(..), m2(..) {
    // Code for the constructor goes here
}
\end{minted}

%You might wonder, wait a minute, I have never write initializer list before, I don't even write a constructor!

To better illustrate our ideas, we make some changes to our original \texttt{IntSet}, specifically 2 changes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We add a line of output to the ctors to indicate with constructor is being called.
	\item We make 2 more ``version" of our original \texttt{IntSet}, one \texttt{OddIntSet} and \texttt{EvenIntSet}. They only allow odd and even numbers, respectively.
\end{itemize}

We now propose a slightly faster \texttt{IntSet}. This \texttt{IntSet} is composed of an \texttt{OddIntSet} and \texttt{EvenIntSet}. It dispatches the operation on integers to those two sub-\texttt{IntSet}. 
%
%Well, if you don't provide any initializer list, the compiler calls the default constructor on every ctor, if a default ctor is available. If the default ctor is not available, a compile error is thrown.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Initializer list: Example}
We create a main function and instantiate an instance of \texttt{FastIntSet}. We observe the following ouput:
\begin{minted}{text}
OddIntSet dft ctor
EvenIntSet elt ctor
fIntSet ctor
\end{minted}
This implies an initialization order of \texttt{oddSet-evenSet-ctor}. This follows from our expectation. 

\vspace{0.1in}
A (not so important) remark we would like to make is
\begin{itemize}
	\item The order of initialization of the members is guaranteed by standard. It's NOT a UB!
	\item Contrary to intuition \textit{it is not specified by initializer list}, but by the order they appear in the declaration.
	\item Base objects are guaranteed to be initialized before members.
	\item We recommend you to specify the init-list in the same order as the declaration, for clearance.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Initializer list: Default initialization}
We now make a tiny change to the original setup. We change the ctor for \texttt{FastIntSet} to 
\begin{minted}{c++}
FastIntSet::FastIntSet() 
    : oddSet() {cout << "fIntSet ctor\n";}
\end{minted}

Oops, we forgot to specify initializer for \texttt{evenSet}.

\begin{minted}{text}
OddIntSet dft ctor
EvenIntSet dft ctor
fIntSet ctor
\end{minted}

\texttt{evenSet} is still initialized, no surprise, otherwise the invariant for \texttt{oddSet} would be broken. Members are default constructed, if they don't appear in the initializer list. We could even simply write 

\begin{minted}{c++}
FastIntSet::FastIntSet() {cout << "fIntSet ctor\n";}
\end{minted}

Which will produce the same result. Now what about members like \texttt{int}? Well, you can think of them as a class, whose default constructor does nothing at all!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Initializer list: Default initialization}
We can even leave out the constructor for \texttt{FastIntSet} entirely. In which case we would have the following output.

\begin{minted}{text}
OddIntSet dft ctor
EvenIntSet dft ctor
\end{minted}

Essentially the compiler would synthesize (create) and constructor for you, whose initializer list initializes everything using their default constructor.  

You might wonder, wait a minute, I have never write initializer list before, I don't even write a constructor before this lesson! That's how you ``get away" with writing constructors before!

Modern design principal is against leaving things unspoken. If you believe you only need a default constructor, you could do:

\begin{minted}{c++}
IntSet::InSet() = default; // In class decl.
\end{minted}

Next up we will look at something that is not taught in class, but problems you will meet in your own struggle with C++.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Initializer list: Default initialization}
We first change the ctor of \texttt{FastIntSet} to 
\begin{minted}{c++}
FastIntSet::FastIntSet() 
    : oddSet() {cout << "fIntSet ctor\n";}
\end{minted}

Then we \textbf{remove the default ctor} for \texttt{EvenIntSet}.

We compile the program. The question is what SHOULD happen?

\pause
\vspace{0.1in}
From a design point of view, if a class does not provide a default constructor, indicates the class is not (more likely should not be) default constructible, there is no way to setup a invariance without supplying an argument. Think about it, what should be the default skin color for an instance of a human class? None.

In this case, any reasonable design would require an compile error is thrown. This is exactly the case. They compiler will look for \texttt{evenIntSet::evenIntSet()} and reports a not-found error. \alert{Situation is similar if you leave out the entire ctor of \texttt{FastIntSet}.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why initializing in initialization list is better?}
You are asked this question in the lecture slides but the question is left unanswered in the lecture slides.

\vspace{0.1in}
Frankly the questions really should be the other way around: on what grounds do initialization in the code is better? I can think of the following reasons you should prefer (in some cases you have to use) initialization list:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Performance. This will be discussed later on. In some cases the performance could be significant.
	\item Exception safety. We will discuss this when we you learn the rule of big three (five, actually).
	\item A member that don't have a default constructor must be initialized in the initialization list.
	\item \texttt{const} members and references can only be initialized in the initialization list.
	\item Semantic reasons.
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Comments on the performance argument}
A final comment on the performance argument. Suppose we write 
\begin{minted}{c++}
FastIntSet::FastIntSet() {
  cout << "fIntSet ctor\n";
  oddSet = OddIntSet(); evenSet = eventSet(10);
}
\end{minted}
You will observer 5 lines of output:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{text}
OddIntSet dft ctor // EvenIntSet dft ctor //
fIntSet ctor // OddIntSet dft ctor // EvenIntSet elt ctor //
\end{minted}
Things that actually happened (with significant cost) are :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Your member variables are first default constructed.
	\item Calls your constructor.
	\item You create 2 temporal objects, by default construction.
	\item You invoke an assignment operator and uses your temporal object to overwrite the member variables. 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
